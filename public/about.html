<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a motivated and industrious individual. From my early days, I have been good with
  numbers. Fittingly enough, I pursued honours in mathematics. In addition, I find myself
  inclined towards statecraft, which is why I continued my academic pursuit with a Masters
  in Public Administration. Now, with these two titles in my tally, I wish to broaden my
  academic horizons by applying to a prestigious institution abroad.</p>
